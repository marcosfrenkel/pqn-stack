A distributed node based approach to quantum networks. This repository hosts all the code necessary to make nodes of the PQN function (except for the frontend located [here](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-gui)).

Our Node is composed of multiple components. All components inside a node are part of an in internal intranet with no external world access except for quantum links to other hardware or the _Node API_.

* **Node API**: FastAPI based, handles communications with web-ui as well as Node to Node communication. Only component in a Node than can talk to other components and the outside world. Resides in [src/pqnstack/app/main.py](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-stack/blob/master/src/pqnstack/app/main.py).
* **Lightweight Web UI**: Designed for the general public to be able to interact with quantum networks. Resides in its own repository [here](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-gui).
* **Router**: Routes messages between _Hardware Providers_, PQN developers and _Node APIs_. Uses ZMQ sockets to communicate between machines. Resides in [src/pqnstack/network/router.py](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-stack/blob/master/src/pqnstack/network/router.py).
* **Hardware Provider**: Hosts hardware resources that are provided to whoever needs them inside a Node through the use of ProxyInstruments. Resides in [src/pqnstack/network/instrument_provider.py](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-stack/blob/master/src/pqnstack/network/instrument_provider.py).

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> **Hardware Requirements**: To do anything interesting with this software currently requires real quantum hardware components (TimeTagger, rotators, etc.). We are actively working on fully simulated hardware components to enable single-machine demos without physical devices, but this capability is not yet available.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Quantum hardware components (TimeTagger, compatible instruments)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-stack.git
   cd pqn-stack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   
   # Or sync with the --extra flag to run the full node
   uv sync --extra webapp
   ```

### Starting a Node

To fully start a PQN Node, you need to initialize 4 different processes:

* **Node API**
* **Router**
* **Hardware provider** (optional)
* **Web GUI** (optional)

### Node API

#### Config file

Before starting a Node API, you need to set up a configuration file:

1. **Copy the example configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp configs/config_app_example.toml config.toml
   ```

2. **Edit the configuration:**
   Open `config.toml` in your editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual settings (router addresses, instrument names, etc.).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The configuration file **must** be named `config.toml` and placed at the root of the repository. If you use a different name or location, the API will not be able to find it.

#### Run the FastAPI instance
For a quick run you can simply run to get started:

```bash
   uv run fastapi run src/pqnstack/app/main.py
```

Please take a look at the [FastAPI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/) for more options on how to run the API

### Router and Hardware Provider

Both the Router and Hardware Provider can be configured in two ways:

1. **Using CLI flags** - Pass configuration directly as command-line arguments
2. **Using a config file** - Use the `--config` flag with a path to a TOML configuration file (see example in [configs/config_messaging_example.toml](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-stack/blob/master/configs/config_messaging_example.toml))

The config file can contain settings for both router and provider:
- Router settings go under `[router]`
- Provider settings go under `[provider]` with instruments defined as `[[provider.instruments]]`

Command-line arguments override config file settings.

#### Starting the Router

```bash
# Using CLI flags
uv run pqn start-router --name router1 --host localhost --port 5555

# Using a config file
uv run pqn start-router --config configs/config_messaging_example.toml
```

#### Starting an Instrument Provider

```bash
# Using a config file (recommended for defining instruments)
uv run pqn start-provider --config configs/config_messaging_example.toml

# Using CLI flags with inline JSON for instruments
uv run pqn start-provider \
  --name provider1 \
  --router-name router1 \
  --instruments '{"dummy1": {"import": "pqnstack.pqn.drivers.dummies.DummyInstrument", "desc": "Test Instrument", "hw_address": "123456"}}'
```

### Web GUI

For instructions on how install and start the web GUI please see the repo where it lives at [https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-gui](https://github.com/PublicQuantumNetwork/pqn-gui)
